          Welcome to Fhiro. This Privacy Policy explains how we handle your data during our 
          <strong>Early Access / Waitlist phase</strong>. As a provider of compliance infrastructure 
          for the <span class="text-white">European Health Data Space (EHDS)</span>, we hold ourselves 
          to the highest standards of data sovereignty and security.
        </p>

        <h3 class="text-white mt-10">1. Who We Are</h3>
        <p>
          For the purposes of the GDPR, this project is currently managed by:
          <br />
          <strong>Project Lead:</strong> Jinish Rajan (Trading as Fhiro)
          <br />
          <strong>Location:</strong> Dublin, Ireland
          <br />
          <strong>Contact:</strong> <a href="mailto:privacy@fhiro.com" class="text-[#10B981] no-underline hover:underline">privacy@fhiro.com</a>
        </p>
        <p class="text-sm bg-[#1E293B] p-4 rounded-lg border border-[#334155]">
          <em>Note: Fhiro is in a pre-incorporation phase. This policy will be formally updated upon legal entity registration in Ireland.</em>
        </p>

        <h3 class="text-white mt-10">2. The Data We Collect</h3>
        <p>
          Currently, we only collect data necessary to manage our "Opening Q1 2025" rollout:
        </p>
        <ul class="list-disc pl-5 space-y-2">
          <li><strong>Contact Information:</strong> Your email address (via the Waitlist Form).</li>
          <li><strong>Professional Verification:</strong> We may request your Medical Council Number (MCN) or practice details to verify your eligibility, as Fhiro is exclusive to registered practitioners.</li>
          <li><strong>Usage Data:</strong> Minimal, anonymized telemetry to ensure site performance and security.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3 class="text-white mt-10">3. Purpose & Legal Basis</h3>
        <p>
          We process your data based on <strong>Consent</strong> (joining the waitlist) and <strong>Legitimate Interest</strong> (preventing fraud and ensuring only qualified professionals access the platform).
        </p>
        <p>We use your data to:</p>
        <ul class="list-disc pl-5 space-y-2">
          <li>Secure your spot in the Q1 2025 rollout queue.</li>
          <li>Verify your status as a registered healthcare professional in Ireland.</li>
          <li>Notify you of critical compliance updates related to the <em>Health Information Bill 2024</em>.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3 class="text-white mt-10">4. Data Sovereignty (The "eu-west-1" Promise)</h3>
        <p>
          We do not rely on US-based cloud storage for sensitive data. 
          All waitlist and verification data is stored and processed exclusively within the <strong>European Union (Ireland)</strong>, utilizing AWS eu-west-1 infrastructure to ensure alignment with EHDS requirements.
        </p>

        <h3 class="text-white mt-10">5. Your Rights</h3>
        <p>
          Under the GDPR, you have the right to access, rectify, or erase your data at any time. 
          If you wish to leave the waitlist, simply email <a href="mailto:privacy@fhiro.com" class="text-[#10B981] no-underline hover:underline">privacy@fhiro.com</a> and we will delete your record immediately.
